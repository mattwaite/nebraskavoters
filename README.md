# Nebraska's small county voters - fewer and farther right

In the wake of the 2016 presidential election, I grabbed data from the Nebraska Secretary of State's office and looked at voter registration and presidential vote total trends in Nebraska's 93 counties since 2000. The Jupyter Notebook and included datasets describe what I found -- as small town Nebraska shrinks, it's shifting further right, and the Democratic Party is collapsing in some parts of the state, leading to decreased political diversity in more than half of the state's counties. 

All data is from the [Secretary of State's elections website](http://www.sos.ne.gov/dyindex.html#boxingName). The visualizations are using ggplot2 in R.
